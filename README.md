# voxel2quake

This tool let you create stuff using Gopixel editor, then save as txt
and convert that txt file into a map file you can load in Trenchbroom.

Is intended to quickstart a map with some geometry, not for final art.

Is a first experiment, so it don't optimize anything. Generates 1 brush for each cube in the voxel original file, so might be horrible broken for large numbers of cubes.

It does not support textures, but would not be hard to implement, since already have a idea of "color" of the voxel cube.
